# hello-world
My first repository, pay it no mind.

I am interested in Swift, Java, JavaScript and recently was introduced to C#.

I have been scratching at the coding bug for years, but couldn't have faltered a few times. Recently, I joined a MeetUp group for PreCoders and found myself setting up my github account.

I am still at the getting my feet wet stage for all of these languages, and hope to be swimming in the deep end before I know it.
